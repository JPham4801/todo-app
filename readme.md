Task Buddy is a todo app that allows users to add, edit, delete, and easily manage their tasks. It helps you keep track of your daily activities and stay organized. This app was built as part of a coding boot camp's project to showcase our understanding of *MongoDB*, *Express*, and *Node.js* (*MEN* Stack).
